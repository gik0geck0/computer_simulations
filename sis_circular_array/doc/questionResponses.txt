    a.  All parts match
    b.  Why should the results differ from Example 1.3.6?
        Rounding. Since we're using a computer, we have much more precision
    c.  The tradeoffs that arise from the optimum is an increase in holding and setup cost to decrease the shortage cost to a very low value.
        by having a higher holding cost, if demand were to suddenly drop, that holding cost would maintain a high course.
    d.  This optimum isn't necesarily well defined. If demand values were to change, the optimum would too, so the optimum isn't very
        well defined for S=80. This can be characterized by 1.3.8, which models a changing demand.
1.3.8 Questions
    a.  
    b.  The statistical outputs are very sensitive. Rotating causes the curvature
        of the dependant cost to introduce new "dips", shift optimum, and shift
        "slightly" up and down in minimum and maximum. Iterestingly enough, though
        the optimum seemed to stay between 20 and 25, focused around 22. In
        graphs/fig_138_dep_r0.png, which represents the original, compared to
        graphs/fig_138_dep_r30.png, (rotated 30), the optimal 's' is higher, and
        around 's' ~= 10, the dependent costs vary widely, which is much in contrast
        to rotation of 0.
