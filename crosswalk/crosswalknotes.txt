Crosswalk is a Next-Event Simulation

Units
1 residential block = 330ft

Distance pedestrians must walk to the button: 3.5 blocks
Distance cars drive to the stop-point: 3.5 blocks - 12 ft
Distance pedestrians walk across the crosswalk: 48ft

Speed of cars: uniform(25, 35) mph
Speed of peds: uniform(6, 13) ft/s

StopLight state: G,Y,R
when ped pushes button,
    Y = max(1s+now, 14s+last_green)
when Y
    R = Y + 8
when R
    G = R+12

Arrivals (exponential)
Autos: average 4 per minute per lane
Peds: 4 per minute (total)

walktime = 48/pedspeed = time for the pedestrian to cross the crosswalk
when ped arrives at button:
    if Y: walk at R
    if R: if G-now >= walktime, walk.
        else: --TODO
    if G:
        if alone, 2/3 check for press now
            if not press, press at now+60s
        if others, 1/n check for press now

when car made:
    atstopwalk at (3.5*330 - 12) / speed

when car at stopwalk:
    if G, leave sim at (3.5/330 + 24) / speed
    if Y, atstopwalk at R   -- Do a single-event delay.
    if R, leave sim at G
